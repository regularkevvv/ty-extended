# Installing ty-extended

## Running ty without installation

Use [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to quickly get started with ty:

```shell
uvx --from ty-extended ty
```

## Installation methods

### Adding ty-extended to your project

!!! tip

    Adding ty-extended as a dependency ensures that all developers on the project are using the
    same version of ty.

Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (or your project manager of choice) to add ty-extended
as a development dependency:

```shell
uv add --dev ty-extended
```

Then, use `uv run` to invoke ty:

```shell
uv run ty
```

To update ty, use `--upgrade-package`:

```shell
uv lock --upgrade-package ty-extended
```

### Installing globally with uv

Install ty-extended globally with uv:

```shell
uv tool install ty-extended
```

To update ty, use `uv tool upgrade`:

```shell
uv tool upgrade ty-extended
```

### Installing with the standalone installer

ty-extended includes standalone installers on GitHub releases.

=== "macOS and Linux"

    Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/latest/download/ty-installer.sh | sh
    ```

    If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    ```console
    $ wget -qO- https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/latest/download/ty-installer.sh | sh
    ```

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/download/v0.60.0/ty-installer.sh | sh
    ```

=== "Windows"

    Use `irm` to download the script and execute it with `iex`:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/latest/download/ty-installer.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/download/v0.60.0/ty-installer.ps1 | iex"
    ```

!!! tip

    The installation script may be inspected before use:

    === "macOS and Linux"

        ```console
        $ curl -LsSf https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/latest/download/ty-installer.sh | less
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```pwsh-session
        PS> powershell -c "irm https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases/latest/download/ty-installer.ps1 | more"
        ```

    Alternatively, the installer or binaries can be downloaded directly from [GitHub](#installing-from-github-releases).

### Installing from GitHub Releases

ty release artifacts can be downloaded directly from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/regularkevvv/ty-extended/releases).

Each release page includes binaries for all supported platforms as well as instructions for using
the standalone installer via `github.com` instead of `astral.sh`.

### Installing globally with pipx

Install ty-extended globally with pipx:

```shell
pipx install ty-extended
```

To update ty, use `pipx upgrade`:

```shell
pipx upgrade ty-extended
```

### Installing with pip

Install ty into your current Python environment with pip:

```shell
pip install ty-extended
```

### Using ty with Bazel

[`aspect_rules_lint`](https://registry.bazel.build/docs/aspect_rules_lint#function-lint_ty_aspect)
provides a Bazel lint aspect that runs ty. See its documentation for setup instructions.

## Adding ty to your editor

See the [editor integration](./editors.md) guide to add ty to your editor.

## Shell autocompletion

!!! tip

    You can run `echo $SHELL` to help you determine your shell.

To enable shell autocompletion for ty commands, run one of the following:

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(ty generate-shell-completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval "$(ty generate-shell-completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

=== "fish"

    ```bash
    echo 'ty generate-shell-completion fish | source' > ~/.config/fish/completions/ty.fish
    ```

=== "Elvish"

    ```bash
    echo 'eval (ty generate-shell-completion elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
    ```

=== "PowerShell / pwsh"

    ```powershell
    if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
      New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
    }
    Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& ty generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
    ```

Then restart the shell or source the shell config file.
