</p>

ty-extended builds on [Astral's ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) and keeps the command-line
executable named `ty`. The fork adds a semantic extension protocol, a Rust SDK for extension
authors, and live WASM extension execution.

## Highlights

- 10x - 100x faster than mypy and Pyright
- Comprehensive [diagnostics](./features/diagnostics.md) with rich contextual information
- Configurable [rule levels](./rules.md), [per-file overrides](./reference/configuration.md#overrides), [suppression comments](./suppression.md), and first-class project support
- Designed for adoption, with support for [redeclarations](./features/type-system.md#redeclarations) and partially typed code
- [Language server](./features/language-server.md) with code navigation, completions, code actions, auto-import, inlay hints, on-hover help, etc.
- Fine-grained [incremental analysis](./features/language-server.md#fine-grained-incrementality) designed for fast updates when editing files in an IDE
- Editor integrations for [VS Code](./editors.md#vs-code), [PyCharm](./editors.md#pycharm), [Neovim](./editors.md#neovim) and more
- Advanced typing features like first-class [intersection types](./features/type-system.md#intersection-types), advanced [type narrowing](./features/type-system.md#top-and-bottom-materializations), and
    [sophisticated reachability analysis](./features/type-system.md#reachability-based-on-types)

## Getting started

Run ty with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) to get started quickly:

```shell
uvx --from ty-extended ty check
```

ty will check all Python files in the working directory or project by default.

See the [type checking](./type-checking.md) documentation for more details.

## Installation

To install ty-extended, see the [installation](./installation.md) documentation.

To add the ty language server to your editor, see the [editor integration](./editors.md) guide.

## Extension SDK

ty-extended publishes two Rust crates for extension authors:

- [`ty_plugin_protocol`](https://crates.io/crates/ty_plugin_protocol), the stable wire protocol.
- [`ty_plugin_sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/ty_plugin_sdk), the authoring SDK and WASM export
    surface.

Start with [extension authoring](./extension-authoring.md) to build an extension crate, then use
[extension runtime](./extension-runtime.md) for the host-side execution model.

## Playground

ty has an [online playground](https://play.ty.dev) you can use to try it out on snippets or small
projects.

!!! tip

    The playground is a great way to share snippets with other people, e.g., when sharing a bug
    report.
